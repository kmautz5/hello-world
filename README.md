# hello-world
This is my first folder on Github. よろしくお願いします。
I studied electrical engineering in college and am currently studying programming and Japanese in my free time. 
My goal is to obtain a programming job in Tokyo, where I am living now. 
I love listening to hip hop, electronic, and shoegaze music.
